# Video-chat-WebRTC
A 1-on-1 video chat application build with socket.io and WebRTC interface.

## Installation
- run 'npm install socket.io express nodemon'
- open up your terminal and run 'npm dev' or 'yarn dev'

This is a small application which is showcasing a way to enable two peers to exchange media streams in a bidirectinal mannner.
It's using a socket.io to create a signaling service for sending the session description as well as ICE candidates.

Contributions are always welcome.
